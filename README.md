# Image Enhancement Pipeline

This repository implements an image enhancement pipeline using the **Stable Diffusion Instruct-Pix2Pix** model. It takes an input image, applies textual instructions to modify the image, and generates a visually refined and enhanced version. The project is designed to run efficiently on GPUs.

## Features
- Modify images with descriptive natural language prompts.
- High-quality image generation using Stable Diffusion.
- Customizable inference parameters for precise outputs.
- Easy-to-extend pipeline for creative applications.

## Example Use Case
**Input Image:**  
A raw image of an object, scene, or creature.  

**Prompt:**  
Transformations or enhancements described in natural language.  

**Output Image:**  
A visually enhanced and transformed version of the input image, based on the prompt.
